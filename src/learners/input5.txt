Appendix 2. Characters, states and optimizations in cladistic analysis of the family Scorpionidae.
Character states were scored 0 to 3,? (unknown), or  (inapplicable). Multistate characters were treated as unordered (nonadditive). Refer to Table 3 for data matrix. Terminology follows Vachon (1974) for trichobothrial notation, Couzijn (1976) for segmentation of legs, Hjelle (1990) and Sissom (1990) for segmentation of pedipalps, Prendini (2000a) for pedipalp and metasomal carinae, and Stahnke (1970), Lamoral (1979), Couzijn (1981) and Sissom (1990) for remaining features. Characters corresponding to the lists of Lamoral (1979: table 6), Couzijn (1981: tables 2 and 9), and Prendini (2000a: appendix 3) are denoted, respectively, by the abbreviations BHL, HWC, and LP, followed by the corresponding number. However, character optimizations are based on the optimal tree obtained in the present investigation. Ambiguous optimizations were mostly resolved using ACCTRAN, but DELTRAN was also used in some cases. Five uninformative characters (excluded from all analyses) are indicated by .
